# GPT-2 Pretraining & Fine-tuning

## Introduction

This project consists of two main stages for training a large language model (LLM) based on the GPT-2 architecture:
1. **Pretraining**: In this stage, GPT-2 is trained from scratch on a large corpus of unlabeled text to learn the structure and patterns of natural language (vocabulary, syntax, semantics, and logical reasoning). The objective is to predict the next token in a sequence using a self-supervised learning approach.
2. **Fine-tuning**: Once the model has acquired general language knowledge, it is fine-tuned on a task-specific dataset to adapt its performance to more concrete downstream tasks (e.g., topic-specific text generation or question answering).

## Training Workflow

1. **Pretraining GPT-2**

- **Dataset**: Large-scale, unlabeled textual data that is cleaned and preprocessed (removing spam, encoding issues, etc.).
- **Encoding technique**: Byte-level BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) is used to tokenize text into subword units.
- **Training objective**: Predict the next token using causal (masked) language modeling with a cross-entropy loss function.
- **Model architecture**: Transformer decoder-only architecture with masked self-attention.

2. **Fine-tuning GPT-2**

- **Fine-tuning dataset**: Task-specific labeled datasets (e.g., input-output pairs like question-answer).
- **Fine-tuning strategy**: Continue training the pretrained model using a lower learning rate and fewer epochs to avoid catastrophic forgetting.
- **Use cases**: Fine-tuned models can be applied to tasks like topic-guided text generation, chatbots, or text summarization.
